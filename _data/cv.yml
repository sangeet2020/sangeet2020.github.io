      description:
        - As a part of MS thesis, built a noise robust automatic speech recognition system (STT) (German language) capable to work under hostile conditions like search and rescue missions. Also, train RNN based large language models for speech recognition.
        - Trained open-source attention-based BiRNN punctuation restoration system+TruCasing for the German language. The system outperformed the baseline model- Vosk model by over 14% in recall metric.

        - Training and testing (with in-domain/out-of-domain data) Czech punctuator system for live ASR.
        - Perform domain adaptation for live ASR by fine-tuning LM by using speaker-specific data.
        # - Set up pipelines for the <a href="https://github.com/ELITR/elitr-testset"> ELITR test set </a> and to get it ready for evaluation.

      description:
        - Developed a system for cross-lingual topic identification in low resource scenarios for Kinyarwanda, Zulu, Hindi and Reuters corpus.
        - Achieved a remarkable weighted average precision score of 0.52 (on 10 different topics) on Kinyarwanda language by learning a simple linear transformation from this language to English language space.
        # - Attained significant improvement of results for multilingual document classification on Reuters corpus compared to the existing framework.
        # - Primary task- text feature extraction, training classifier, generating document embeddings, and learning transformation from unknown language to English space.

    - title: English and Chinese poetry generation
      year: 2022
      description: English poetry generation and comparison (using PPL as evaluation metric) using LSTM, encoder-decoder based models, and transformer model (GPT). We conclude that fine-tuning GPT-2 model generated the highest quality poems i.e. with the least PPL score. Also trained a topic-prediction model to study how well a machine-generated poem is interpreted by a system trained on human-written poems. <a href="https://bit.ly/3t05QWE"> Report </a> | <a href="https://github.com/palla-lin/SoProPoetry/tree/sangeet"> Code </a>
      
    - title: Span extraction based slot-filling using attention and RNNs
      year: 2022
      description: Performed slot-filling (and intent recognition) using RNN on a multi-head attention mechanism. The main idea was to model the slot-filling task as a span extraction and to utilize available information about slot type for which value is to be provided. F1 score of 0.83 was achieved compared to 0.96 of the baseline model. <a href="https://bit.ly/3mbCRvf"> Report </a> | <a href="https://github.com/sangeet2020/dialogue-processing"> Code </a>

    - title: Evaluating and defending against stealthy backdoor attacks
      year: 2022
      description: Presented defense strategies that counter backdoor attacks. These defenses significantly decrease the attack success rate (by 77%) on specific samples designed by the attacker. We do this by transforming each input such that the trigger words get replaced in the input, and the attack is not triggered. These defenses can be used without any significant runtime costs. <a href="https://bit.ly/3PLMC0t"> Report </a>

    - title: Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word estimation using subword representation
      year: 2021
      description: Achieved a better OOV rate and perplexity score than the baseline for three levels of granularity (char level, small, large vocab) with appropriate hyperparameter tuning. This was done by training RNN based language model to artificially generate corpus and compute OOV rate on varying sizes of the generated corpora. <a href="https://bit.ly/3GrMeA5"> Report </a> | <a href="https://github.com/nik1806/snlp_project"> Code </a>
