<h4> Basic info </h4>
Hi, I am Sangeet Sagar, a natural language processing (NLP) enthusiast with a M.Sc. degree from Saarland University. With over 3 years of research experience, I am particularly passionate about speech and language technology, specializing in end-to-end speech recognition, speech enhancement, and language modeling.

Currently, I am interning at Airbus, Munich with the Airbus Defence and Space team, where I am working on speech recognition projects. I am excited to be a part of this cutting-edge technology and look forward to making a meaningful contribution to the field.

<h4> Research Interest </h4>
My research interests revolve around improving speech and language technology by applying deep learning techniques. I am particularly interested in noise-robust automatic speech recognition, speech denoising, and dialogue processing. I aim to explore novel approaches to develop efficient and effective models that can adapt to different noise levels and speech conditions. Furthermore, I am interested in developing end-to-end deep learning pipelines that can perform data-loading, training, and performance evaluation of speech and language processing models.

<h4> Academic Qualification </h4>
- (M.Sc.) Universität des Saarlandes, Saarbrücken, Germany, Department of Language Science and Technology
- Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics, Charles University, Prague, Czechia
- Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czechia
- (B.Tech.) The LNM Institute of Information Technology, Jaipur, India

<h4> Interests </h4>
In addition to my professional pursuits, I am an enthusiastic solo traveler who has explored more than 15 countries. I relish the opportunity to immerse myself in diverse cultures, try new cuisines, and meet new people. My travels have afforded me unforgettable experiences and introduced me to inspiring individuals. Additionally, I have a deep passion for photography and enjoy documenting my journeys through captivating photos and videos.

Feel free to contact me for any opportunities or collaborations in the field of NLP and speech technology.
