Hi, I am Sangeet Sagar, a natural language processing (NLP) enthusiast with a M.Sc. degree from Saarland University. With over 3 years of research experience, I am particularly passionate about speech and language technology, specializing in end-to-end speech recognition, speech enhancement, and language modeling.

Currently, I am interning at Airbus, Munich with the Airbus Defence and Space team, where I am working on speech recognition projects. I am excited to be a part of this cutting-edge technology and look forward to making a meaningful contribution to the field.

In addition to my professional pursuits, I am an enthusiastic solo traveler who has explored more than 15 countries. I relish the opportunity to immerse myself in diverse cultures, try new cuisines, and meet new people. My travels have afforded me unforgettable experiences and introduced me to inspiring individuals. Additionally, I have a deep passion for photography and enjoy documenting my journeys through captivating photos and videos. You can browse through my work here: [Pictures](https://www.eyeem.com/u/sagar2020)

Feel free to contact me for any opportunities or collaborations in the field of NLP and speech technology.
