## Terminal friendly `gdrive`
To easily backup your trained model, dataset, logs, etc. to your Google Drive using a simple CLI, you can follow these steps:

1. First, download the gdrive CLI tool by running the following commands:
```bash
wget https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive/releases/download/2.1.1/gdrive_2.1.1_linux_386.tar.gz
tar -xvf gdrive_2.1.1_linux_386.tar.gz
./gdrive
```

2. To make the `gdrive` command accessible from any directory, you can create a directory of your choice to store the `gdrive` binary file, such as `/home/sagar/bin/`. Then, add the path to this directory to your `$PATH` environment variable in your `~/.bashrc` file by running:
```bash
mkdir /home/sagar/bin/
export PATH=$PATH:"/home/sagar/bin/" # enter this in your bashrc
```

3. Now, copy the `gdrive` binary file to your chosen directory:
```bash
cp gdrive /home/sagar/bin/
```

4. To upload an entire directory recursively to your Google Drive, you can use the following command:
```bash
gdrive upload --parent <destination_id> --recursive <source_directory>
```
Replace `<destination_id>` with the ID of the destination folder in your Google Drive and `<source_directory>` with the path to the directory you want to upload. E.g. `https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/118mOZ771FOJiQMKRxX` this is indeded upload web-link of your google-drive, the destination id is `118mOZ771FOJiQMKRxX`


5. To upload a single file to your Google Drive, you can use the following command:
```bash
gdrive upload --parent <destination_id> <source_file>
```
Replace `<destination_id>` with the ID of the destination folder in your Google Drive and `<source_file>` with the path to the file you want to upload.

By following these steps, you can easily backup your files to your Google Drive using a simple CLI.
